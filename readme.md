The current challenge is a crypto CTF challenge that utilizes AES encryption in CBC mode. The goal of the challenge is to decrypt a secret message that has been encrypted with a randomly generated key. The difficulty level of this challenge would be considered intermediate-hard, as it requires a basic understanding of AES encryption and how it works in CBC mode, as well as knowledge of how to use the Pycrypto library to encrypt and decrypt messages.

The vulnerability in this challenge is related to the use of padding in the encryption process. Specifically, the message is not padded correctly before encryption, resulting in a ciphertext that cannot be decrypted correctly. This type of vulnerability is known as a padding oracle attack, which can allow an attacker to decrypt the ciphertext without the need for the key.

The challenge was created by generating a random key and using it to encrypt a known message using AES in CBC mode. The key and ciphertext were then saved to files, and the challenge is to decrypt the ciphertext using the key.

To solve this challenge, the first step would be to read in the key and ciphertext from the provided files. Next, the AES cipher object should be created in CBC mode and the ciphertext should be decrypted. However, since the padding is incorrect, the resulting plaintext will be unreadable. To fix this, the padding must be removed manually by stripping off any trailing whitespace characters. Once this is done, the plaintext should be readable and the original message can be revealed.



AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric key encryption algorithm that is widely used to secure sensitive information. It uses a fixed-length key (128, 192 or 256 bits) to encrypt and decrypt data.

CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode is a block cipher mode that improves the security of a plaintext message by chaining together multiple blocks of ciphertext. In CBC mode, before encrypting a block of plaintext, the previous ciphertext block is XORed with the plaintext block. This makes the encryption of each block of plaintext depend on all the previous blocks, which improves the security of the encryption.

In this challenge, the participant is given a file called "ciphertext.bin" which contains the AES encrypted message and a file called "key.bin" which contains the AES key used for encryption. The goal is to decrypt the ciphertext and reveal the original message. The participant will have to determine the key and the encryption mode used in order to decrypt the ciphertext.
